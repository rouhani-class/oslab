<h1>Operating Systems Labratory: Syllabus</h1>
<p>You can download a PDF version of this syllabus <a href="oslab-syllabus.pdf">here</a></p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
An undergraduate-level understanding of operating systems concepts. 

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>This course is  primarily designed for undergraduate students. In this course you will be learned how to work and administrating unix-like operating systems, system programming , and writing shell scripts. We do not emphasize on using a specific distro of unix-based operating systems, if you are currently working with one of them and you are familiar with using unix-based operating systems , then you are free to use your favorite distro. And if you are not familiar with them , then we will teach you how to start using them. The topics which will be covered are :  
<ul>
  <li>History of Unix and Linux Operating Systems</li>
  <li>Introducing Linux and Unix Distributions</li>
  <li>Bootstrapping Scenario</li>
  <li>File Systems
      <li>
        Systems Directories
      </li>
  </li>
  <li>Design Write Up (11/6): Send us a draft of your project write up, focusing
on the motivation and design of your system, sans an evaluation.</li>
  <li>Full Write Up (12/9): Send us a complete version of your write up,
including everything in the design write up plus an evaluation of your
system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Ideas</h2>

<p>You're welcome to propuse your own project ideas. Here are some suggestions
that might be helpful starting points.

<p>Shenango:
<ul>
  <li>Shenango currently provides a highly optimized implementation of TCP/IP,
but its transport-layer processing still incurs significant overheads, wasting
several cores on I/O to sustain max throughput. Instead, use rDMA hardware (Like
the Mellanox ConnectX-4) to offload transport layer processing into hardware
(see <a href="https://github.com/linux-rdma/rdma-core">libibverbs</a>). Build
and evaluate support for two-sided rDMA in the Shenango runtime. How much more
efficient could Shenango be if we moved these functions into hardware?</li>
  <li>Power management features like CPU frequency scaling and parking idle
cores can make CPUs more energy proportional. Unfortunately, these features have
high transition delays, and typically harm tail latency. Design a scheduling
policy in Shenango that hides these latencies from latency-sensitive
applications, while still reducing power consumption when CPU load is low.</li>
  <li>Compatibility can be a major barrier to adoption for systems, even if they
significantly improve performance. For example, Shenangoâ€™s pthread support is
more than 10x faster than Linux, but lacks support for thread-local storage.
Using the <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/x86_64/fsgs.html">latest Intel
instructions</a>, investigate whether this feature could be supported without
sacrificing efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<p>Datacenter tax:
<ul>
  <li>One of the biggest challenges of accelerating the datacenter tax (memory
copying, serialization, RPC, memory allocation, etc.) is its fine-grained and
tightly coupled nature, making the high latency of PCIe bus a barrier to
deploying accelerators for these functions. Instead, use a dedicated CPU core to
simulate a new specialized hardware design that is integrated on-die with the
processor (i.e., cache coherent and low latency). Evaluate how much your
hypothetical accelerator could improve efficiency overall.</li>
</ul>

<p>Library operating systems and containers:
<ul>
  <li>Using a tool like <a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor">gVisor</a>,
could you transform entire legacy software systems into simple functions that
you can call and stitch together?</li>
</ul>
